# Week 3 - Greedy Algorithms

"Apply greedy strategy to solve various computational problems. This will usually require you to design
an algorithm that repeatedly makes the most profitable move to construct a solution. You will then
need to show that the moves of your algorithm are safe, meaning that they are consistent with at least
one optimal solution."
