# Algorithms Part 1 (Princeton/Coursera)

Bob Sedgewick

## Syllabus

An introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures. Our emphasis is on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.

Part I focuses on elementary data structures, sorting, and searching. Topics include union−find, binary search, stacks, queues, bags, insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, 3-way quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, binary heaps, binary search trees, red−black trees, separate-chaining and linear-probing hash tables, Graham scan, and kd-trees.

Part II focuses on graph and string-processing algorithms. Topics include depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju−Sharir, Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman−Ford, Ford−Fulkerson, LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries, Knuth−Morris−Pratt, Boyer−Moore, Rabin–Karp, regular expression matching, run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression and Burrows−Wheeler transform. Part II also introduces reductions and intractability, including the P = NP problem.
