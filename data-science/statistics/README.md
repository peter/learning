## Vocabulary

* [Descriptive Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics) - helps understanding by summarizing data (sample or population) with quantitative metrics related to concepts like central tendency (mean, median), variability (standard deviation, kurtosis, skew, min/max, range, quartiles, percentiles).
* [Inferential Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) - testing a hypothesis about a population and its probability distribution based on a sample and a statistical model. Outcome of inferential statistics can be a point estimate, a confidence internal, or the rejection of a hypothesis. A statistical model is a set of
assumptions abbout the data. A common parametric assumption is that the population has normal distribution with unknown mean and variance and that random sampling is used. The central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean "for very large samples" is approximately normally distributed, if the distribution is not heavy tailed.

From [Statistic for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjZJIVWHnPE&t=647s):

* [Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population) - everything being studied (i.e. all college students)
* [Parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parameter) - some characteristic of the population (i.e. GPA of college students, usually represented by greek letters)
* [Sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)) - a portion of the larger population (i.e. 200 college students)
* [Statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic) - characteristic of a sample (i.e. average GPA of 200 college students, denoted by english letters). A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is any quantity computed from values in a sample, often the mean.
* [Variable](https://stattrek.com/descriptive-statistics/variables.aspx) - characteristic of interest gathered from each item in the sample (the question)
* Data - actual values of the variables
