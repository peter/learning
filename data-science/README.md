## What is Data Science?

Data science:

* "is about extracting insights from messy data"
* "brings together three things: statistics, programming, and product knowledge"

## What is Statistics?

[Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) "is a branch of
mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation,
presentation, and organization of data"
