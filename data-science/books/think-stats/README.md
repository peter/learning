## Preface

"This book is an introduction to the practical tools of exploratory data analysis.
The organization of the book follows the process I use when I start
working with a dataset:"

* Importing and cleaning
* Single variable explorations
* Pair-wise explorations. Looking at tables and scatter plots.
* Multivariate analysis
* Estimation and hypothesis testing. How big is the effect? How
much variability should we expect if we run the same measurement
again? Is it possible that the apparent effect is due to chance?
* Visualization. Communicating results.

Some ideas that are hard to grasp mathematically are easy to understand
by simulation.

Data sources:

* The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), conducted by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to gather
“information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility,
use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health.” (See
http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm.)

* The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), conducted
by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion to “track health conditions and risk behaviors in the United
States.” (See http://cdc.gov/BRFSS/.)
