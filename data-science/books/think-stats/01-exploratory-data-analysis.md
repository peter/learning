# Chapter 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis

As an example of guiding decisions under uncertainty we use the
example question:

Do first babies tend to arrive late?

Some people claim it’s true, others say it’s a myth, and some people say it’s the other way around: first babies come early.

Anecdotal evidence usually fails because of:

* Small number of observations
* Selection bias
* Confirmation bias
* Inaccuracy

## A Statistical Approach

* Data collection
* Descriptive statistics
* Exploratory data analysis (look for patterns)
* Estimation (use sample to draw conclusions about population)
* Hypothesis testing (evaluate whether difference between two groups is by chance)
