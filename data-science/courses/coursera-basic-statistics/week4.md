## 4.8 Binomial distribution

Distribution assumes constant probability of binary outcome and independence of outcomes.

Can be right skewed (peak to the left, p=0.1), left skewed (peak to the right, p=0.9),
or symmetrical (p=0.5) depending on p (probability for success.)

Mean is n*p and sigma (std deviation) is square root of n*p*(1-p) (meaning p=0 and p=1 has sigma zero and p=0.5 has maximum sigma).
