# Nand to Tetris Coursera Course

## Project 1

"A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc., as well as their bit-wise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine). This project engages you in the construction of a typical set of basic logic gates. These gates form the elementary building blocks from which more complex chips will be later constructed."

"Build all the logic gates described in Chapter 1 (see list below), yielding a basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them."
