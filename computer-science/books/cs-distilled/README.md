Notes from the book Computer Science Distilled.

## Appendix

### Numerical Basis

Information can be expressed as numbers. Number systems are based
on sums of digits. Each digit in position i is multiplied by d (the number base)
to the power of i. Examples:

```
# Hexadecimal base 16
10E1 -> 4096+0+224+16=4321

# Binary base 2
1000011100001 -> 4096+128+64+32+1=43321
```

### Gauss' Trick

The story goes that Gauss was asked by his elementary school teacher
to sum numbers from 1 to 100 (a [geometric series](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricSeries.html)).

```
(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) ... = 100*101/2 = 5050
n*(n+1)/2
```
