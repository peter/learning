"In October 2017, Firebase launched Cloud Firestore, a realtime document database as the successor product to the original Firebase Realtime Database"

The origins of Firebase is an online chat application developed in 2011.

Prior to the Firestore database "Firebase’s largest customers often hit the service’s hard limit of 100,000 concurrently connected devices and had to split their databases across shards".
