# The Go Language

## The Pitch for Go

* A simple and easy to learn language
* Static/strong typing
* Garbage collected
* High performance
* High concurrency support built into the language
* Low memory footprint (significantly lower than Java, slightly higher than C or Rust)
* Is deployed as a single binary without any dependencies
* Fast compiles
* Good developer tooling
* Comprehensive standard library with http/networking, testing etc.
* Created and backed by Google and is very popular

## Hello World

From the [getting started page]((https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started)):

```sh
mkdir hello
cd hello
go mod init example/hello
```

```golang
// file hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

```sh
go run .
```
